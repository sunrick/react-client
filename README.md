This is the start of the first major React project I was working on.

Code is a bit rough as I was learning a lot about React on this project.

It uses Mobx for state management, React router for routing and some other cool tech.

It was originally meant to be like Slack with live video feeds.

It was abandoned before we could set up channel logic for videos, and chat.
